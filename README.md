# FUZZY-SYSTEM-INSPIRED-BY-SMART-WATCH
This system demonstrates how fuzzy logic can be applied in health monitoring applications, offering an interpretable, human-like reasoning model that mimics the functionality of modern wearable devices.

This project presents a Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) inspired by smartwatch technology to monitor and evaluate human health conditions. The system takes physiological parameters such as blood pressure, body temperature, age, oxygen saturation, sleep quality, and heart rate as inputs. Using fuzzy logic, it applies membership functions and rule-based inference to classify overall health conditions.

The inspiration comes from smartwatches, which continuously track fitness activities, sleep patterns, heart rate, and blood pressure to provide personalized health insights. Our contribution includes designing and implementing the fuzzy system in Python, visualizing the membership functions, applying inference rules, and simulating the system with real-like health input data to predict and assess health status.
